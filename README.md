## by (Olayiwola Idris)
## Dataset

> - After a previous wranging data, there are 174952  bike trips with 12 features:
- Time of trip: duration_sec, start_time, end_time:
- Ids: bike_id;
- stations:  start_station_id, start_station_name, end_station_name, end_station_id,;
- User: user_type, member_gender, member_birth_year; 
- Other: bike_share_for_all_trip.

## Summary of Findings

> Summarize all of your findings from your exploration here, whether you plan on bringing them into your explanatory presentation or not.

- It is observed that  (90.5%) of the users are subscriber, while (9.5%) are Customer.

- It is observed that  start station around 58 has the highest number of trip.
- It is observed that  start station around 67 has the highest number of trip.
- from the visualization we can see that both violinplot and boxplot shows the customer Member birth year less than 1965 are outliers while subscriber Member birth year less than 1960 are outliers. Also there has been customer user_type since 1880 while subscriber user_type started around 1900.
- It is observed that male duration is relatively higher than female duration while other is lower than both.
